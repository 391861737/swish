/**
 * @c Abstract ISftpProvider outer layer that translates exceptions.
 *
 * Subclass this adapter and implement @c provider_interface to get a
 * COM component supporting @c ISftpProvider.
 *
 * This adapter class handles the translation of C++ exceptions to COM error
 * codes.  It has a public COM interface which it implements and subclasses
 * provide an implementation of provider_interface to which calls are delegated.
 * The provider_interface methods are free to throw any exceptions derived
 * from std::exception as well as any that you handle using your own
 * @c comet_exception_handler override.  This class catches those exceptions
 * translates them to COM error codes and IError info and sets output
 * parameters as appropriate.
 *
 * The adapter ensures that the final COM object obeys COM rules in several
 * ways:
 *
 * - On entry to a COM method it first clears any [out]-parameters.  This is
 *   required by COM rules so that, for example, cross-apartment marshalling
 *   doesn't try to marshal uninitialised memory (see item 19 of 
 *   'Effective Com').
 * - If certain required parameters are missing, it immediately returns a
 *   COM error without calling the inner C++ method.
 * - Then it calls the inner method.
 * - Catch any exception, calling @c SetErrorInfo with as much detail as
 *   we have available, and translate it to a COM @c HRESULT.
 * - Return the HRESULT or set the [out]-params if the inner function didn't
 *   throw.
 *
 * As the return-values are no longer being used for error codes, the inner
 * methods are sometimes changed to return a value directly instead of using
 * an [out]-parameter.
 *
 * Although the adapters make use of Comet, they do not have to be instantiated
 * as Comet objects.  They work just as well using ATL::CComObject.
 *
 * Only error translation code should be included in this class.  Any
 * further C++erisation such as translating to C++ datatypes must be done in
 * by the subclasses.
