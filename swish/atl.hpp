/**

 * Any files that need ATL support should include this header to ensure
 * that ATL is set up consistently across different files and projects.
 *
 * This file must be included before any other ATL headers as they depend
 * on <atlbase.h> and <atlcom.h> already being included.  Also, any macros
 * in this file must be allowed to affect the behaviour of other parts of 
 * ATL.  This is contrary to the usual top-down include order.
