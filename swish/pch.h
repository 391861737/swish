/**
 * @file
 *
 * This file exists @b solely to include other headers which will be
 * precompiled to reduce build times.  The source files which include this
 * header should not depend on anything in it.  In other words, this file
 * is an optimisation alone and all files should still compile if
 * USING_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS is not defined.
 *
 * @note  It is specifically forbidden to add anything other than #include
 * statements to this file.
 *
 * The top-level of the Swish solution is set to force-include this header
 * in all source files.  Therefore, it doesn't have to be included
 * explicitly.  All projects that want to use precompiled headers must have 
 * pch.cpp in their sources and set to Create Precompiled Header (/Yc) in 
 * order to output the compiled header.
 *
 * If a project needs its own set of precompiled includes, it can just
 * override the Create/Use PCH Through File and Force Includes properties
 * for the project.
