swish-0.2.1.7
-Files and folders can be renamed.  If an item with the chosen name already
 exists, we offer to overwrite it.  Due to the limitations of SFTP versions 4
 and below, we do this non-atomically which is not ideal.  Time will tell
 whether this is more trouble than it's worth.

swish-0.2.1.6
-Files and folders can be deleted from the Explorer window.  If a directory
 contains other items, we deleted these recursively using separate calls to the
 server.  This is a bit clunky but we are limited by what SFTP supports.

 requests can reuse them without prompting the user for a password or having to
 renegotiate with the server.

-Replace the PuTTY-based dataprovider component with one based in libssh2. This
 is vastly more stable. The new backend has all the abilities of the of the
 old one with a few exceptions, namely, host-verification (aka known_hosts),
 key-interactive authentication and public-key authentication. Replacing these
 is a priority.
-The frontend has been integrate much more closely with Explorer.

 doesn't work in Windows 98 yet).

 host information from the user
