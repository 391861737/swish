	 * than @c WM_NCCREATE and @c WM_NCDESTROY) as we can't be sure of the
	 * fields' integrity outside of this 'safe zone'.  For example, when
	 * common controls 6 is enabled setting an icon before @c WM_CREATE
	 * fails to show the icon.
	 *
	 * To prevent capturing creation of windows not directly part of our
	 * dialog template, such as the system menu, we engage our CBT hook for
	 * as short a period as possible.  Therefore we have to detach ourselves
	 * in this function rather than from the CBT hook.
