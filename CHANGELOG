swish-0.2.1.4
-Replace the PuTTY-based dataprovider component with one based in libssh2. This
 is vastly more stable. The new backend has all the abilities of the of the

 is a priority.

-Connections are added with a dialog invoked from the Tools menu and are stored 
 in the registry.
-Explorer displays the default icon for files based on their extension (this
 doesn't work in Windows 98 yet).
-Subfolder can be navigated.
-The default explorer context menu is displayed when right-clicking a file.
