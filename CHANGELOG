swish-0.2.1.10
-Now supports Windows Vista.

swish-0.2.1.9
-Added support for the keyboard-interactive authentication scheme:
 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4256.txt).
-Improved robustness of the low-level backend session handling in the face
 of errors.

swish-0.2.1.8
-Fixed bug when overwriting existing directories.

swish-0.2.1.7
-Files and folders can be renamed.  If an item with the chosen name already 
 exists, we offer to overwrite it.  Due to the limitations of SFTP versions 4
 and below, we do this non-atomically which is not ideal.  Time will tell
 whether this is more trouble than it's worth.

swish-0.2.1.6
-Files and folders can be deleted from the Explorer window.  If a directory
 contains other items, we deleted these recursively using separate calls to the
 server.  This is a bit clunky but we are limited by what SFTP supports.

swish-0.2.1.5
-SFTP sessions (connections) are now pooled in the COM ROT so that subsequent
 requests can reuse them without prompting the user for a password or having to 
 renegotiate with the server.

swish-0.2.1.4
-Replace the PuTTY-based dataprovider component with one based in libssh2. This
 is vastly more stable. The new backend has all the abilities of the of the 
 old one with a few exceptions, namely, host-verification (aka known_hosts),
 key-interactive authentication and public-key authentication. Replacing these
 is a priority.
-The frontend has been integrate much more closely with Explorer.
-Connections are added with a dialog invoked from the Tools menu and are stored 
 in the registry.
-Explorer displays the default icon for files based on their extension (this
 doesn't work in Windows 98 yet).
-Subfolder can be navigated.
-The default explorer context menu is displayed when right-clicking a file.

swish-0.2.1
-Created a data provider component to wrap PuTTY's SFTP client (psftp.exe)
 permitting listing of files in a directory
-Linked data provider to front end using simple dialog box for requesting
 host information from the user

swish-0.2
-All previous prototype code discarded
-Created Explorer namespace extension with window explorer window showing
 three dummy host connection items
-Used SHCreateShellFolderView to create default shell view window giving
 best possible Explorer integration
-Created PIDL Manager to handle host (connection) folder item
-Added conection item details to Details and Tiles view
-Created Remote Folder displaying dummy file listing which is displayed by
 double-clicking (or otherwise opening) host connection in initial folder

swish-0.1.1
-Experimentation with Visual Studio and linking with gcc-compiled libssh

swish-0.1-gcc
-Experimentation using gcc, wxWidgets and libssh-0.11
