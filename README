What is Swish?
    Swish is a project to integrate access to remote files via SFTP into the 
    Microsoft Windows Explorer.
    
Status:
    Swish is currently very experimental.  Most of the effort so far has gone 
    into making the development tools/platform and the underlying SSH library 
    (libssh) work together.  
    
    The current development environment is GCC under Cygwin/MinGW with the
    wxWidgets widget tool-kit and libssh-0.11 with the unofficial Windows 
    patch.
    
    In this version, Swish can connect to a remote server 
    (hardcoded address) as a particular user (again, hardcoded) allowing the 
    user to enter a password on the command-line.  *The password is not
    obscured on the console so care must be taken when entering it*. Swish will
    then retrieve a file-listing from the /tmp directory of the target machine
    and display this in a list in the GUI.  Some of the fields, such as file 
    permissions and parsed and displayed in a more friendly form.  Directories
    are colour-coded yellow.  
    
    As of yet, NO attempt has been made to INTEGRATE WITH EXPLORER.  The work
    so far is just proof-of-concept concerned with SFTP connectivity.

Requirements:
    GCC/G++ and associated build tools
    wxWidgets (compiled in same cygwin-dependency mode as Swish, i.e. if Swish
        is compiled with -mno-cygwin flag or with MingGW then wxWidgets must 
        be as well)
    libssh-0.11 with unofficial Windows patch
