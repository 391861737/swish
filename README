What is Swish?
    Swish is a project to integrate access to remote files via SFTP into the 
    Microsoft Windows Explorer.
    
Status:
    ********************************************************************
    In this version, Swish can only LIST the files in a remote directory
    and their properties.

    Swish is currently very experimental.  Most of the effort so far has gone 
    into demonstrating a proof-of-concept rather than creating a finished,
    usable application.  
    
    The architecture of Swish is divided into a back-end and a front-end.  The
    former deals with the SFTP connection to remote hosts while the latter
    is concerned with displaying the results to the user and handling 
    interaction.
    
    While the eventual aim is to offer a choice of back-end implementations
    with different capabilities, the only one currently available is a
    wrapper around PuTTY which can connect to a remote host and list the
    contents of a directory.  
    Swish can only cope with very simple authentication interaction at this
    point (e.g. simple password, unknown host).  If it encounters any
    interaction that is is not anticipating IT WILL CRASH EXPLORER.  Due to
    limitations in the backend, it is also very prone to timing issues.

Requirements to run:
    Internet Explorer 5.01 or greater.
    For Windows 9x, the Microsoft Layer for Unicode (MSLU, aka Unicows)

Requirements to build:
    Visual C++ 2005 (Express edition is unlikely to work as the code uses
        ATL attributes which, I believe, require ATL 7).
    WTL 8 which can be obtained from Microsoft of through SourceForge

Requirements for testing:
    CppUnit (works with v1.12.0, may work with other versions) must be present
    on the local machine.  Many tests also require a remote host available to
    connect to over SSH.  Swish assumes this is unix-based.
    
    Environment variables:
    CPPUNITDIR: The location of the CppUnit files.
    TEST_HOST_NAME: The name of the remote testing host.
    TEST_USER_NAME: The user name of the SSH account on the remote host.
    TEST_HOST_PORT: The port on the remote host that SSH is listening on 
        (optional - defaults to 22 if not set).
    TEST_PASSWORD:  The password to use to connect to the remote host if 
                    required.
