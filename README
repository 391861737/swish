What is Swish?
    Swish is a project to integrate access to remote files via SFTP into the 
    Microsoft Windows Explorer.
    
Status:
    Swish is currently very experimental.  Most of the effort so far has gone 
    into making the development tools/platform and the underlying SSH library 
    (libssh) work together.  
    
    The development environment has been changed to Visual Studio 2005 
    (Visual C++) in order to reduce the haslle and make use of GUI toolkits
    such as ATL/WTL or MFC.  Currently development of the back-end SFTP
    connection mechanism is not taking place and a dummy dataset will be
    used while the front-end is developed.

    All previous prototype code has been abandoned and development started
    afresh as per the project plan

    In this version, Swish consists purely of a window integrated into
    Windows Explorer displaying a few dummy host connection items.

Requirements:
    Visual C++ 2005 (Express edition is unlikely to work as the code uses
        ATL attributes which, I believe, require ATL 7)
    WTL 8 which can be obtained from Microsoft of through SourceForge
