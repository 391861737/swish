What is Swish?
    Swish is a project to integrate access to remote files via SFTP into the 
    Microsoft Windows Explorer.
    
Status:
    Swish is currently very experimental.  Most of the effort so far has gone 
    into making the development tools/platform and the underlying SSH library 
    (libssh) work together.  
    
    The development environment has been changed to Visual Studio 2005 
    (Visual C++) in order to make use of MFC for constructing the GUI.  Efforts
    have been made to continue using the libssh-0.11 with the unofficial 
    Windows patch.  Although this combination is able to compile and link, it 
    does not run.  Libssh-0.2 is due to be released soon and promises Windows 
    compatibilty, therefore, it would seem sensible to wait for this before
    continuing development.
    
    In this version, Swish can do very little except compile
    
    As of yet, NO attempt has been made to INTEGRATE WITH EXPLORER.  The work
    so far is just proof-of-concept concerned with SFTP connectivity.

Requirements:
    Visual C++ 2005 (not Express edition - MFC required)
    libssh, a version able to compile under Windows and properly link and run 
        with Visual C++ programs
