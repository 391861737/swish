 * Checks if the values in the dialog box fields are valid.
 *
 * Criteria:
 * - The name field must not be empty.
 * - The user name field must not be empty, must not contain more than 
 *   @ref MAX_USERNAME_LEN characters and must not contain any characters
 *   from @ref FORBIDDEN_CHARS.
 * - The host name field must not be empty, must not contain more than 
 *   @ref MAX_HOSTNAME_LEN characters and must not contain any characters
 *   from @ref FORBIDDEN_CHARS.
 * - The path field must not be empty, must not contain more than 
 *   @ref MAX_PATH_LEN characters and must not contain any characters
 *   from @ref FORBIDDEN_PATH_CHARS.
 * - The port field must contain a number between 0 and 65535 (@ref MAX_PORT).

 * @pre the dialog must have been initialised by calling DoModal() or

 *
 * @returns
 *     @retval true if all fields meet the validity criteria.
 *     @retval false if any field fails the criteria.
 *
 * @todo The validity criteria are woefully inadequate:
 * - There are many characters that are not allowed in usernames or hostnames.
 *   The test should really check that characters are all from an allowed list
 *   rather than not from a forbidden list.
 * - Windows usernames can contain spaces.  These must be escaped.
 * - Paths can contain almost any character.  Some will have to be escaped.
 * @todo Use balloons or some other method to warn the user of problems as 
 *       they complete the fields.
